📘 Help Guide – Blog Frontend Project

If you're trying to run this project locally and the blog posts are not loading, please read this:

❗ Why it doesn't work by default:
Browsers block fetch() from loading local JSON files via the file:// protocol for security reasons.

✅ How to fix it:

OPTION 1 – Use Live Server (VS Code):
1. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Install the 'Live Server' extension (if not installed)
3. Right-click on index.html → Click 'Open with Live Server'
4. Your browser will open at http://127.0.0.1:5500/
5. Blog posts will now load properly

OPTION 2 – Use Python Simple HTTP Server:
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run:
   python -m http.server 8000
3. Visit: http://localhost:8000/index.html

OPTION 3 – Use Node.js http-server:
1. Run:
   npm install -g http-server
2. Then:
   http-server
3. Visit: http://localhost:8080 (or the provided link)

📂 Project Files:
- index.html → Blog list page
- post.html → Detailed view for a single post
- blog-data.json → JSON file simulating blog API
- script.js → Loads blog cards
- post.js → Loads single post based on URL ID

💡 Tip:
This project uses static JSON to simulate an API.
To use real data, connect it to a backend or REST API.
